CG_PredictPlayerState

Generates cg.predictedPlayerState for the current cg.time
cg.predictedPlayerState is guaranteed to be valid after exiting.

For demo playback, this will be an interpolation between two valid
playerState_s.

For normal gameplay, it will be the result of predicted userCmd_s on
top of the most recent playerState_s received from the server.

Each new snapshot will usually have one or more new usercmd over the last,
but we simulate all unacknowledged commands each time, not just the new ones.
This means that on an internet connection, quite a few pmoves may be issued
each frame.

OPTIMIZE: don't re-simulate unless the newly arrived snapshot playerState_s
differs from the predicted one.  Would require saving all intermediate
playerState_s during prediction.

We detect prediction errors and allow them to be decayed off over several frames
to ease the jerk.
