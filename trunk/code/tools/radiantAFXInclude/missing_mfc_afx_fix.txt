If you're getting "cannot open afxwin.h" errors while compiling Radiant.vcproj, download Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 (or any other version with MFC) and copy MFC dir here.
The paths should look like this:
qio/code/tools/radiantAFXInclude/MFC/Include
qio/code/tools/radiantAFXInclude/MFC/Lib
qio/code/tools/radiantAFXInclude/MFC/SRC
