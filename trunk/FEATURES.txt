game
 - written from scratch with C++ class system
 - serverside Bullet physics for rigid bodies and cars
 - player movement is done by Bullet character controler
 
cgame 
 - cleared up code
 - better communication with renderer
 
renderer
 - written from scratch in C++
 - Quake3, RTCW, ET, MoHAA and CoD1 (partial) BSP support with PVS and lightmapping
 - direct .map files loading
 - openGL backend totally separated from frontend
 - basic DirectX 9 backend
 - VBO/IBO based (several times faster than Q3 renderer)
 - deltaRefEntities system

modelLoader
 - written from scratch in C++
 - waveFront .obj support (with .mtl files)
 - usefull .mdpp (MoDelPreProcess) "scripts" system used to scale/rotate model after loading
 
materialSystem
 - written from scratch in C++
 - BASIC q3 shaders support
 
common
 - interfaces system similiar to one in SourceEngine

shared
 - many math, geometry and util C++ classes
 - autoCvar_c class for easier ConVars usage
